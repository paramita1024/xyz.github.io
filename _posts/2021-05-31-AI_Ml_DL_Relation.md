# Artificial Intelligence
Unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals, which involves consciousness and emotionality Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines (computer). It enables computers and machines to mimic the perception, learning, problem-solving, and decision-making capabilities of the human mind. 
It learns from experience, adjust to new inputs and perform human-like tasks.


# Machine learning
 Machine learning is a subset of AI application that learns by itself and improve without explicitly being programmed. It actually reprograms itself, as it digests more data, to perform the specific task with increasingly greater accuracy. 

# Deep Learning
Deep Learning is an approach to Machine Learning; one that focuses on learning data representations rather than on task-specific algorithms. It makes use of Deep Neural Networks, which are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.


#Data Science
"Data science is the study of the generalizable extraction of knowledge from data‚Äù. 
Data science takes advantage of big data and a wide array of different studies, methods, technologies, and tools including machine learning, AI, deep learning, and data mining.

# Relation b/w AI Ml & DL
"Artificial intelligence is a set of algorithms and intelligence to try to mimic human intelligence. Machine learning is one of them, and deep learning is one of those machine learning techniques." 
In other words, Artificial Intelligence (AI): Human Intelligence Exhibited by Machines
Machine Learning (ML): An Approach to Achieve Artificial Intelligence
Deep Learning (DL): A Technique for Implementing Machine Learning
