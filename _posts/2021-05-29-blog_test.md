# Artificial Intelligence
Unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals, which involves consciousness and emotionality Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines (computer). AI is a computer system able to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence. It enables computers and machines to mimic the perception, learning, problem-solving, and decision-making capabilities of the human mind. It learns from experience, adjust to new inputs and perform human-like tasks.


# Machine learning
 Machine learning is a subset of AI application that learns by itself learn and improve without explicitly being programmed. It actually reprograms itself, as it digests more data, to perform the specific task with increasingly greater accuracy. 
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning application that teaches itself to perform a specific task with increasingly greater accuracy, without human intervention.

# Deep Learning
Deep Learning is an approach to Machine Learning; one that focuses on learning data representations rather than on task-specific algorithms. It makes use of Deep Neural Networks, which are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.

# Relation b/w AI Ml & DL
"Artificial intelligence is a set of algorithms and intelligence to try to mimic human intelligence. Machine learning is one of them, and deep learning is one of those machine learning techniques."
