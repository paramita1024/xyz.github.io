###  :wave: Hi there,

Thanks for stopping by.

:rocket: I am a self-motivated individual with keen interest in **Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing**. Presently I work as a Data Scientist in the Digital and Smart Analytics (DSA) team in [<span style="color:blue">Swiss Re, India</span>](https://www.swissre.com/).

:dart: Earlier I received my Master of Science (MS by research) degree in **Machine Learning** from the [<span style="color:blue">Department of Computer Science and Engineering</span>](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/) at [<span style="color:blue">Indian Institue of Technology, Kharagpur</span>](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/). There I was a Junior Research Fellow (JRF) and was an active member of the Complex Network Research Group ([<span style="color:blue">CNeRG</span>](http://www.cnergres.iitkgp.ac.in/)). My supervisors were [<span style="color:blue">Dr. Sourangshu Bhttacharya</span>](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~sourangshu/) and [<span style="color:blue">Dr. Niloy Ganguly</span>](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ernet.in/~niloy/). I used to work in the field of _Spatio-Temporal Data Mining and Machine Learning_ and my thesis topic was: **Learning Problems in Transportation Network**. 

Before pursuing MS degree, I used to work as a Programmer Analyst in [<span style="color:blue">Cognizant Technology Solutions India Pvt. Ltd.</span>](https://www.cognizant.com/), Kolkata, India.	

:game_die: I received my Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) degree in [<span style="color:blue">Computer Science and Engineering</span>](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/view_department.php?deptid=59) from [<span style="color:blue">Jadavpur University</span>](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/), India in 2013. In my final year project I worked under the guidance of [<span style="color:blue">Prof. Mita Nasipuri</span>](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/profile.php?uid=651) on the project Skin Lesion Segmentation.


**Recent Update:**


- üìù I occasionally write `scribe` on differnt ML, DL, NLP topics. They are available at [github.com/blog](https://msank00.github.io/blog/) or [notion.so/scribe](https://www.notion.so/45244be573394099870f529ebba1cefd?v=a3362ad417594f2b9d08369216122cce). 
- ‚ö° Sometime I love to write `paper summary`. You can find them at [notion.so/papernotes](https://www.notion.so/c472d5aeba9b4effb13a4a3df7aac0b4?v=b7862439954140ec8f9fe5a5a02b2b1e).
