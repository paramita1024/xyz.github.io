## Projects

### XBRL Financial Tagging:
Built a **CNN** (Convolution Neural Network) model to map various sections (text paragraph) of directors report of a financial statements. Here, I automated the tagging of various paragraphs into suitable business compatible header by multi class classification using CNN. Also performed sentiment analysis to triage auditor's comments. 
I also contributed to build the framework for mapping system fields from client's financial data to tax filing template, using \textbf{Siamese-LSTM} architecture.

 ### Sentence Similarity and Clustering:
 The task is to find similar ideas (given in text) provided by various participants in an innovation challenge. Here, I built similarity service after converting the ideas into **USE** (Universal Sentence Encoder) embedding. Also clustered the similar ideas using embedding matrix with the help of **Affinity Propagation**.



### :camera: :bookmark_tabs: Image Caption Generation

`Image Caption Generation` is a challenging task where a textual description is generated given a picture. It needs both methods from **Computer Vision** and **Natural Language Processing** to connect the image feature with words in the right order.
